![](Images/polarith-ai.png)

[Polarith AI](http://polarith.com/ai/) offers all you need for achieving
state-of-the-art movement AI with just a few clicks. Design complex movement
behaviours and create immersive games or astonishing simulations by taking
advantage of the sophisticated workflow.

This repository belongs to the official Unity plugin ([Free
version](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/92029) and [Pro
version](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#!/content/71465)). It contains
additional content you may find useful if you want to write own behaviours. So
if you want to extent the plugin for your needs, have a closer look at the
source code we publish here and learn how relatively easy behaviours can be
implemented.

**All sources require Unity and a version of the plugin Polarith AI to work
properly.**
